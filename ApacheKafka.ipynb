    "# Introduction to Event Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Event streaming is a technology paradigm for continuously capturing, storing, processing, and reacting to events happening across your business or applications in real time. It fundamentally changes how data is handled, moving away from batch processing to a continual flow of data.\n",

    "- **High Throughput**: Capable of handling millions of events per second.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally to accommodate growing data.\n",
    "- **Fault Tolerance**: Robust against system failures, ensuring no data loss.\n",
    "- **Real-Time Processing**: Enables immediate data processing and decision making.\n",
