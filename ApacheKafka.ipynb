    "# Introduction to Event Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Event streaming is a technology paradigm for continuously capturing, storing, processing, and reacting to events happening across your business or applications in real time. It fundamentally changes how data is handled, moving away from batch processing to a continual flow of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Event streaming platforms like Apache Kafka enable the collection, integration, and analysis of massive streams of event data from multiple sources.\n",

    "## What is Apache Kafka?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that provides high-throughput, highly scalable, and fault-tolerant event streaming capabilities. It is designed to handle real-time data feeds and provides a unified platform for both producing and consuming data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **High Throughput**: Capable of handling millions of events per second.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally to accommodate growing data.\n",
    "- **Fault Tolerance**: Robust against system failures, ensuring no data loss.\n",
    "- **Real-Time Processing**: Enables immediate data processing and decision making.\n",
